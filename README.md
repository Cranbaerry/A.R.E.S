# AVatar Logger GUI

Thx to [KeafyIsHere](https://github.com/KeafyIsHere) for the original avatar logging script!

Allows for easy searching of the VRChat cache folder for a particular avatar that has been previously encountered via the use of a simple [GUI](https://i.imgur.com/9wAvbfJ.png).

Installation:
	
	1. Install Melon Loader(https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe).
	
	2. Run VRchat once, this will allow melon to build the necessary mod files
	
	3. Download "Avatar Logger GUI V2.5.rar" from releases and extract its contents to your VRChat folder
	
	4. Place the "Avatar Logger GUI.exe" wherever its convenient
	
Usage:

	1. Open the "Avatar Logger GUI.exe" and follow the built in instructions!
	
	WARNING{Whenever new avatars are logged the parse becomes oudated! To update the parse follow the instructions on the "How To Update Parsed Logs:" section in the GUI!}
			You may also get a false positive for the GUI so here I have provided a virus total scan: (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9b4192e2fd07a4590252d2eeb77944533e7738cf20a892aa31fd2712c2116057/summary)
