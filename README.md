# AVatar Logger GUI

Thx to [KeafyIsHere](https://github.com/KeafyIsHere) for the original avatar logging script!

And special thanks to [cassell1337](https://github.com/cassell1337) for willingly being mindfucked with me while making the semi-auto hotswap!

Allows for easy searching of the VRChat cache folder for a particular avatar that has been previously encountered via the use of a simple [GUI](https://i.imgur.com/02xNo0V.png).

Features:

	-Logs ALL avatars seen in game regardless of them being private or public!
	
	-An easy to navigate and in my opinion extremely sexy GUI
	
	-Ability to search avatar logs by:
	
		-Avatar Name
		
		-Avatar ID
		
		-Avatar Author
		
	-Ability to delete logs and parses from within the GUI
	
	-Browse the logs with image previews of avatars
	
	-Semi-Automatic Hotswap

Plans:

	-A main server containing all avatars ever logged by the logger mod/GUI, this will be opted out by default. If you wish to participate in this once the feature realeases you will have to manually edit your configuration to opt-in to supporting the server!

Installation:
	
	1. Install Melon Loader(https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe).
	
	2. Run VRchat once, this will allow melon to build the necessary mod files
	
	3. Download "Avatar Logger GUI V3.rar" from releases and extract the mods folder into your game directory
	
	4. Place the "GUI" folder wherever it is most convenient
	
	5. Run the "Avatar Logger GUI.exe" and enjoy!
	
Usage:

	1. On first load you will have to select your private log, public log and log folder
	{You will not need to load these three values on every launch!}
	
	2. Parse your logs by pressing the parse button this will prepare your logs to be scanned
	{Every time you log new avatars the parse will need to be updated, to do this press the "Reset Parse" button then the "Parse" button to re-parse your logs}
	
	3. Select your log type and search type, you are now ready to search your logs!
	
	4. If you want to just browse your logs it is as simple as selecting your log type and pressing browse, to go through the list just press the arrow next to the browse button
	
	5. If the GUI begins to run slightly sluggish/slow or your logs have gotten large it is as simple as pressing the "Reset Parse" and "Delete Logs" buttons, once deleted logs and parses cannot be recovered!
	
	6. To utilise the Hotswap button first open a blank unity project and import your avatar SDK
	
	7. Login to the VRChat SDK, create a new game object and attach a blank avatar descriptor to the object
	
	8. Build & publish the blank avatar, give it a name, desc and tags before uploading the avatar
	
	9. You may then navigate to the avatar you would like to Hotswap within the GUI
	
	10. Enter the "Content Manager" within the VRChat SDK and copy the ID of your blank avatar and paste it into the "New Avatar ID" box and press Hotswap
	
	11. The avatars VRCA will be automatically downloaded, unpacked, have its avatar ID swapped out with yours and repacked creating a "custom.vrca" file in the same directory as the GUI
	
	12. In Unity press the build and publish button again and when you reach the screen where you can set your avatars name fill out the fields as you would like (Be sure to tick the box at the bottom agreeing to T&Cs!) then navigate to your %temp% folder
	
	13. In your temp folder locate the folder called "DefaultCompany", enter it and then open the folder with the same name as your Unity project
	
	14. Replace the "custom.vrca" file in this folder with the one generated by the GUI and press "Upload"
	Complete! You may now log on to VRChat and switch into the avatar you had just uploaded!
