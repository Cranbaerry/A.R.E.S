# CachedAvatarLocator

Thx to [KeafyIsHere](https://github.com/KeafyIsHere) for the original avatar logging script!

Allows for easy searching of the VRChat cache folder for a particular avatar that has been previously encountered via the use of a simple [GUI](https://i.imgur.com/LdOsP67.png)
Installation:
	
	1. Install melon loader (https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe) (Latest)
	
	2. Run VRchat once, this will allow melon to build the necessary mod files
	
	3. Download "CachedAvatarLocator VX.rar" from releases and extract its contents to your VRChat folder
	
	4. Place the "Avatar Logger GUI.exe" wherever its convenient

	WARNING{Whenever new avatars are logged the parse becomes oudated! To update the parse follow the instructions on the "How To Update Parsed Logs:" section in the GUI!}
