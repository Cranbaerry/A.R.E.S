ARES is an avatar recovery tool! It is only for educational uses! We do not condone theft of avatars, the tool soley exists to recover avatars from within VRChat back onto new accounts and into their unity packages keeping as much of the avatar in-tact as possible!

Thx to Yui, they have chosen not to be marked as a developer on the project when they might as well be, they taught me everything I know about photon and it is an important part of the project as a whole. If you see him around thank him for me! The same thanks go out to Blaze for showing me a better/more stable way to create buttons ingame!

Thx to [Blaze](https://github.com/WTFBlaze) for helping me fix a few bugs within the wear avatar by ID button added in V10!

Thx to Afton (He doesn't have a GitHub ;-;) for helping me create the unlimited avatar favorites!

Thx to [nesrak1](https://github.com/nesrak1/AssetsTools.NET) for the original "AssetTools.NET.dll" file that was edited by me and then packed into our HOTSWAP allowing for VRCA files to be compressed and decompressed!

Thx to [Requi](https://github.com/RequiDev) for [ReMod.Core](https://github.com/RequiDev/ReMod.Core), we use this as our button API within ARES!

Thx to [Kirai](https://github.com/xKiraiChan) for the code behind our [force clone](https://github.com/Astrum-Project/AstralClone) patch!

Thx to [FACS01](https://github.com/FACS01-01/FACS_Utilities) for the bledshape and animation repairs only compatable with VRCA files extracted with ARES & scanning of the Unity Packages!

Thx to [FatihBAKIR](https://github.com/FatihBAKIR/UnityPacker) for the ability to compress unity files

Thx to [Avatarchik](https://github.com/Avatarchik/UnityPackageExtractor) for the ability to extract unity files
