# Avatar Logger GUI

Thx to [KeafyIsHere](https://github.com/KeafyIsHere) for the original avatar logging script!

And special thanks to [cassell1337](https://github.com/cassell1337) for willingly being mindfucked with me while making the semi-auto hotswap!

If you have any feedback for us or would like to suggest a feature please use our [FeedbackForm](https://forms.gle/QifnS6ZSa8fse9yF7).

I have gone about validating the latest V6.5 package with Microsoft, if a false positive is detected please follow the insructions under GUI>Dist>Submission Details. <<This also works as proof that all files are safe as they were manually reviewed by a Microsoft employee!

Allows for easy searching of the VRChat cache folder for a particular avatar that has been previously encountered via the use of a simple GUI

Features:

	-Logs ALL avatars seen in game regardless of them being private or public!
	
	-An easy to navigate and in my opinion extremely sexy GUI
	
	-Ability to search avatar logs by:
	
		-Avatar Name
		
		-Avatar ID
		
		-Avatar Author
		
		-Uploader Tags
		
	-Ability to delete logs and parses from within the GUI
	
	-Browse the logs with image previews of avatars
	
	-Mostly-Automatic Hotswaping
	
	-HTML Viewer for easy browsing of larger logs!
	
	-Search by tags: These are the tags given during the upload of the avatar
	
	-Version detection: IF your copy is out of dste your application will now propmt you to upgrade!

    -API support! If you are willing to share your logs with us in return you will gain access to a database containing avatars logged by other users!
